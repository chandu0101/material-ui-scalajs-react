A macro creates the actual `js.Object` and a method that accepts \"child props\"/elements.\r\n\r\n[Demo Site](http://wav.github.io/material-ui-scalajs-react/site/classes/index.html)\r\n\r\n## Status\r\n\r\nAt this stage, this is an experiment (low priority).\r\n\r\n## Development notes\r\n\r\nOpen the sampler in the browser with `sbt run`.\r\n\r\nTo update Material UI delete the `material-ui.js` and `material-ui.css` in the resources directory.\r\n\r\nIf something doesn't work, inspect the underlying js.Object's in the console.\r\n\r\nTo make the site, run `sbt run && make-site.sh`","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
